By now I assume that you are familiar with the whole analysis scheme and the **six** step execution process described in [README](https://github.com/jkkbuddika/RNA-Seq-Data-Analyzer/blob/master/README.md) and [USERGUIDE](https://github.com/jkkbuddika/RNA-Seq-Data-Analyzer/blob/master/USERGUIDE.md) sections. In this section I intend to walk you through the whole process *one last time* using a real set of input .fastq files downloaded from public databases. At the end of this step-by-step tutorial, you will have a clear understanding on how to analyze your own RNA-seq datasets using this standard pipeline.

## Download data
In this example I intend to analyze a set of RNA-seq datasets generated from FACS isolated intestinal progenitor cells from [Dutta et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124715006075?via%3Dihub#app1). Based on the paper, they have deposited these datsets in NCBI GEO database with the accession number [GSE61361](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61361). To download this data we will use SRA Toolkit. If you do not have this already installed to your computer you have to do it now. Fortunately for me, Carbonate, the supercomputer I use for data analysis has already installed SRA Toolkit for me.
